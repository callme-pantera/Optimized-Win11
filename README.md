# Optimized Win11: Debloat and Design
This repository documents my work on debloating Windows 11 and enhancing its desktop design. My goal is to record every step I took toward creating a cleaner, more seamless and more enjoyable Windows experience. While this is not meant to serve as a full tutorial, I hope parts of my work may still be useful to others.<br>

**All credit for the debloating process goes to [Chris Titus Tech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech) and his [Windows Utility Repository](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil).**
**All credit for the desktop design improvements goes to [Seelen UI](https://seelen.io/) and their [Repository](https://github.com/eythaann/Seelen-UI).**

<br>

## Overview
This project is divided into two main parts: **system optimization** and **desktop customization**.<br>

The first step was to **debloat Windows 11**; removing unnecessary apps, background services and features that negatively impact performance or clutter the system. This process focused on streamlining the operating system while maintaining stability and functionality. The full documentation of this process can be found in my [Debloat guide](/Debloat/README.md) or directly in the [Debloat folder](/Debloat/).<br>

Once the system was optimized, I moved on to the **design and usability improvements**. Here, I focused on customizing the Windows 11 desktop environment using Seelen UI, aiming for a cleaner, more consistent and more enjoyable interface. This includes visual tweaks, layout adjustments and enhancements to the overall workflow. You can find the full documentation of this process in my [Design guide](/Design/README.md) or in the [Design folder](/Design/).<br>

The combination of these two approaches, debloating and design customization, resulted in a Windows 11 setup that is both lightweight and visually refined, balancing performance with aesthetics.
